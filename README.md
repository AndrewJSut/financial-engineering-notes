# Financial Engineering Notes

This repository contains a curated collection of replications and exploratory notebooks completed while working through various quantitative finance texts and research papers.

The material is not intended as production-quality code. Its purpose is to document mathematical ideas and modelling techniques encountered during my studies in Financial Engineering.

## Structure
### Machine Learning for Asset Managers (Lopez de Prado)

Chapters 2–8 reproduced in Python. I refer to these frequently; it was a great read!
Includes implementations of the core methods discussed in the book, intermediate calculations, and experiments to verify results and intuition.

### Paper Replications

Replications or partial replications of selected quantitative finance papers.
These notebooks focus on understanding the methods and reproducing key figures or numerical results.

### Experiments

Small exploratory notebooks testing concepts in quantitative modelling, data handling, and numerical methods. These are included for completeness rather than polish.

## Note:

This repository acts as a technical archive. It is updated occasionally when exploring new topics but is not maintained as a polished project. For more structured and complete work, refer to my primary repositories.
