# Financial Engineering Notes

This repository contains a curated collection of study notes, replications, and exploratory notebooks completed while working through various quantitative finance texts and research papers.

The material is not intended as production-quality code. Its purpose is to document mathematical ideas, numerical methods, and modelling techniques encountered during my studies. The work here complements my project-focused repositories by showing the underlying research and experimentation that informed them.

## Structure
### Machine Learning for Asset Managers (Lopez de Prado)

Chapters 2–8 reproduced in Python.
Includes implementations of the core methods discussed in the book, intermediate calculations, and experiments to verify results and intuition.

### Paper Replications

Replications or partial replications of selected quantitative finance papers.
These notebooks focus on understanding the methods and reproducing key figures or numerical results.

### Experiments

Small exploratory notebooks testing concepts in quantitative modelling, data handling, and numerical methods. These are included for completeness rather than polish.

## Note:

This repository acts as a technical archive. It is updated occasionally when exploring new topics but is not maintained as a polished project. For more structured and complete work, refer to my primary repositories.
